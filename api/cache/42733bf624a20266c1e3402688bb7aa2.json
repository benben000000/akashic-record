Part of the cost of doing business with the Corps involves paying for overhead -- costs that do not directly relate to a specific project or activity but more generally support agency operations. Overhead costs are included in the amount that Congress appropriates for specific Corps projects and the amount that customers pay for Corps' services. The Corps provides services to customers including other Department of Defense units, federal agencies, state and local governments, Indian tribes, and foreign governments. The Corps' Civil Works program is organized around its headquarters, 8 divisions, and 38 districts nationwide. Only district overhead is charged to projects; overhead for headquarters and divisions is not. You asked GAO to review the Corps' process for building overhead costs into projects. This report examines the following: (1) how the Corps builds overhead costs into its projects, and (2) customers' views on overhead information. To accomplish this, GAO reviewed the Corps' documentation of its overhead and billing processes; interviewed officials at Corps headquarters, 2 divisions, and 4 districts based on geographic location; and interviewed 16 of the highest paying federal and nonfederal Corps' customers in fiscal year 2012. The results of these interviews cannot be generalized to all customers but provided insights. GAO is not making recommendations in this report. The Department of Defense did not provide comments.","identifier":"DTIC_ADA581003","mediatype":"texts","title":"DTIC ADA581003: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers: Building Overhead Costs into Projects and Customers' Views on Information Provided","year":2013},{"creator":"Wells, Helen, 1977-","description":["1 online resource (vii, 231 pages)","The Fast and The Furious: Drivers, Speed Cameras and Control in a Risk Society offers an explanation for the continued debate about one road safety intervention - the speed camera - by situating that debate within contemporary literature about the 'risk society' (Beck, 1992) and more broadly understood experiences of risk faced on a daily basis by drivers.

Violet is the privileged daughter of the American madam of the city's most exclusive courtesan house. But when the Ching dynasty is overturned, Violet is separated from her mother in a cruel act of chicanery and forced to become a \"virgin courtesan.\" Half-Chinese and half-American, she grapples with her place in the worlds of East and West, until she is able to merge her two halves, empowering her to become a shrewd courtesan who excels in the business of seduction and illusion, though she still struggles to understand who she is. Back in 1897 San Francisco, Violet's mother, Lucia, chooses a disastrous course as a sixteen-year-old, when her infatuation with a Chinese painter compels her to leave her home for Shanghai. Shocked by her lover's adherence to Chinese traditions, she is unable to change him, despite her unending American ingenuity. Fueled by betrayals, both women refuse to submit to fate and societal expectations, persisting in their quests to recover what was taken from them: respect; a secure future; and, most poignantly, love from their parents, lovers, and children. To reclaim their lives, they take separate journeys, to a backwater hamlet in China, the wealthy environs of the Hudson River Valley, and, ultimately, the unknown areas of their hearts, where they discover what remains after their many failings to love and be loved. Spanning more than forty years and two continents, this novel transports readers from the collapse of China's last imperial dynasty to the beginning of the Republic and recaptures the lost world of old Shanghai through the inner workings of courtesan houses and the lives of the foreigners living in the International Settlement, both erased by World War II","Hidden jade path -- The new republic -- The hall of tranquility -- Etiquette for beauties of the boudoir -- The memory of desire -- A singing sparrow -- A blue disease -- The two Mrs. Ivorys -- Quicksand years -- Moon Pond village -- Heaven Mountain -- The valley of amazement -- Fata morgana -- Shanghailanders -- The city at the end of the sea"],"identifier":"valleyofamazemen0000tana_j5a9","mediatype":"texts","title":"The valley of amazement","year":2013},{"creator":"Benfari, Robert","description":["Includes bibliographical references (pages 271-273) and index","Introduction: What Makes a Good Manager?

In this book, Russell Johnston tells the story of the people who made it so.\" \"Johnston's setting is the dynamic intersection of business and culture during the early decades of the twentieth century. During this period, he argues, magazines and newspapers grew increasingly dependent on sales of advertising space, and this precipitated a widespread restructuring of the publishing industry. Ultimately, this affected the range and content of Canadian periodicals, setting the parameters for a newly invigorated, though still fragile, Canadian magazine industry. Johnston charts this process by exploring the lives, goals, and ideas of a new breed of solicitor, the ad agent, and shows how agencies began to draw on the disciplines of psychology and economics to promote their products, thus initiating the modern market research industry.\" \"The only thorough analysis of the forces shaping advertising in Canada prior to 1930, this study documents the emergence of a key component of the modern culture of consumption.\"--Jacket","Includes bibliographical references (pages 283-348) and index","Print version record","Intro -- Contents -- Acknowledgments -- Introduction -- 1.

Who doesn't have a basement, attic, closet, or storage unit filled with stuff too good to throw away? Or, more accurately, stuff you think is too good to throw away. When journalist and author Alison Stewart was confronted with emptying her late parents' overloaded basement, a job that dragged on for months, it got her thinking: How did it come to this? Why do smart, successful people hold on to old Christmas bows, chipped knick-knacks, VHS tapes, and books they would likely never reread? She discovered she was not alone. Junk details Stewart's three-year investigation into America's stuff, lots and lots and lots of stuff. Stewart rides along with junk removal teams from around the country such as Trash Daddy, Annie Haul, and Junk Vets. She goes backstage to a taping of Antiques Roadshow, and learns what makes for compelling junk-based television with the executive producer of Pawn Stars. And she even investigates the growing problem of space junk--23,000 pieces of manmade debris orbiting the planet at 17,500 mph, threatening both satellites and human space exploration. But it's not all dire. There are creative solutions to America's overburdened consumer culture. Stewart visits with Deron Beal, founder of FreeCycle, an online community of people who would rather give away than throw away their no-longer-needed possessions. She spends a day at a Repair Cafe, where volunteer tinkerers bring new life to broken appliances, toys, and just about anything. Stewart also explores communities of \"tiny houses\" without attics and basements in which to stash the owners' trash. Junk is a delightful journey through 250-mile-long yard sales, and packrat dens, both human and rodent, that for most readers will look surprisingly familiar\"--","\"When journalist and author Alison Stewart was confronted with emptying her late parents' overloaded basement, a job that dragged on for months, it got her thinking: How did it come to this?
