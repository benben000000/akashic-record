The **Akashic Library** is your window to the world's unlimited knowledge. 
A unified, high-speed interface for accessing millions of **public domain** and **open access** books, papers, and media.

## 🌟 Core Philosophy: Direct Access
We prioritize content that is:
- **Free to Read**: Tuned to filter for "Free Ebooks" and "Full View" documents.
- **Instant**: No waitlists, no borrowing queues (wherever legally possible).
- **Universal**: Connecting Google Books, PubMed, Internet Archive, and Open Library.

## 🚀 Quick Start
1.  **Clone/Copy** to XAMPP `htdocs`.
2.  Start **Apache**.
3.  Open `http://localhost/LibrarySystem/`.

## 📚 Sources
- **Akashic Library (Books)**: Open Library & Internet Archive.
- **Akashic Scholar (Medical)**: PubMed Central (Open Access).
- **Akashic G-Books**: Google Books (Filtered for Free Ebooks).
- **Akashic Archive**: The Internet Archive's full media database.

## ⚖️ Legal
We provide a search engine for **publicly available** data. We do not host content. We facilitate finding the "Needle in the Haystack" of free content on the web.
